## 🧠 Notes

This project is part of my personal Python learning journey.
The main learning goals are:

Python file handling

Modular programming

Terminal UI design using Colorama


## 📦 Next Step Ideas

Add search through notes

Removing a certain part of a note

Add export all notes to one file

List all note files

Create a GUI version later using Tkinter or PyQt
