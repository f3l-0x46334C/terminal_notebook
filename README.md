# 📝 Terminal Notebook

A simple command-line notebook built with Python.  
You can create and edit text notes directly in the terminal — colorful, lightweight, and fast!

> ⚠️ **Status:** In Development  
> Currently, I wrote only option 1. "Add & open new note file" is functional.


## 🚀 Features
- Create and save notes
- Prevent overwriting existing files
- Colored terminal interface (via Colorama)
- Easy to extend and customize

## 🧰 Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

Then install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🖥️ Run the program

```

## 🧠 Note

This is part of a personal learning project — the goal is to practice:

Python OOP
File handling
Terminal UI with colorama
